\section{Introduction}
The production and decay of single top quarks via $t$-channel soley involves electroweak interactions at leading order (LO). The high mass of the top quark allows it to decay to on-shell W bosons before hadroniztation becomes relevant. This allows to measure a variety of standard model (SM) properties such as the CKM matrix element $\mathrm{V_{tb}}$ and the parity-violating V-A coupling structure by studying this process. Furthermore, the top quark may be relevant in beyond-SM theories because it has the highest coupling strength to the Higgs boson and thus contributes to the Higgs self-energy and vaccum stability.

In the following, the latest results by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are reviewed.

\section{Cross section measurements at 8~TeV}
Precise measurements of the $t$-channel single top quark cross section at 8~TeV have been accomplished at the LHC in pp collisions by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations~\cite{atlas-xsec8,cms-xsec8} utilizing data that corresponds to approximately $20~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. For the measurements, events with an isolated muon or electron and two jets are selected where one jet is required to pass the threshold of dedicated b-tagging algorithms. The cross section is measured using a binned maximum-likelihood (ML) fit to a discriminating variable. CMS exploits the pseudo rapidity distribution of the non b-tagged jet that is produced in the forward detector region for single top quark events (Fig.~\ref{fig:fit-xsec-8}a) whereas ATLAS combines multiple observables in one powerful discriminant by training a neutral network (Fig.~\ref{fig:fit-xsec-8}b).

\end{figure}

The measured inclusive cross section is used to set a limit on the CKM matrix element $|\mathrm{V_{tb}}|\equiv\sqrt{\sigma_\mathrm{obs.}/\sigma_\mathrm{theo.}}$. This procedure makes no assumptions on the number of quark generations or the unitariy of the CKM matrix. The measured cross sections at 8~TeV together with the extracted limits on $\mathrm{|V_{tb}|}$ are 
\begin{align}
\sigma_{t\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}^\mathrm{ATLAS}&=82.6\pm1.2\mathrm{(stat)}\pm12.0\mathrm{(syst)}~\mathrm{pb}, &\Rightarrow |\mathrm{V_{tb}}|>0.78~\mathrm{(95\%~CL,~8~TeV)}, \\
\sigma_{t\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}^\mathrm{CMS}&=83.6\pm2.3\mathrm{(stat)}\pm7.4\mathrm{(syst)}~\mathrm{pb} &\Rightarrow |\mathrm{V_{tb}}|>0.92~\mathrm{(95\%~CL,~7+8~TeV)}
\end{align}

which are compatible with the expectation of $86.5_{-1.0}^{+2.8}\mathrm{(scale)}_{-2.2}^{+2.0}\mathrm{(PDF)}~\mathrm{pb}$ at next-to-leading order (NLO)~\cite{Kidonakis-8tev}.

In addition to the inclusive cross section, the fiducial cross section has been measured as well~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-15-007,atlas-xsec8}. It provides a deep test of the theory by restricting the measurement only to the detector acceptance. The advantage is that fiducial measurements do not inherit theoretical uncertainities that account for extrapolations into an experimentally unprobed phase space.





\section{Charge ratio measurements}
The cross section charge ratio $\sigma(t)/\sigma(\bar{t})$ has also been measured~\cite{atlas-charge7,cms-xsec8}. It is particular sensitive to the parton distribution functions (PDF). Figure~\ref{fig:charge-ratio} shows measurements by CMS (8~TeV) and ATLAS (7~TeV) compared to different PDF sets. Similar tensions in both measurements for some sets are observed.

\end{figure}

\section{Electroweak coupling structure}
Single top quark events allow to probe the electroweak V-A structure because of the Wtb vertex in production and decay. Deviations can be characterized in terms of anomalous Wtb couplings that arise from effective dimension-six operators. A novel analysis technique to set limits on anomalous couplings has been developed by ATLAS~\cite{atlas-anomcoupl}. It utilizes two differential distribution with respect to the polar~(Fig.~\ref{fig:angles}a) and azimunthal~(Fig.~\ref{fig:angles}b) angles of the lepton in the reconstructed W boson rest frame.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\parbox[t]{0.3\textwidth}{\centering\includegraphics[width=0.29\textwidth]{atlas_anomcoupl/phi.pdf}\\(a)}
\parbox[t]{0.3\textwidth}{\centering\includegraphics[width=0.29\textwidth]{atlas_anomcoupl/theta.pdf}\\(b)}
\parbox[t]{0.38\textwidth}{\centering\includegraphics[width=0.36\textwidth]{atlas_anomcoupl/limits.pdf}\\(c)}
\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:angles}The~(a) polar and (b)~azimuthal angles of the lepton in the W boson rest frame and (c)~the infered limits on the anomalous tensor-like right-handed Wtb coupling over the SM coupling.}
\end{figure}

An event-based likelihood is constructed for both angles using an analytical folding model that accounts for finite resolution, acceptance and reconstruction inefficiencies. Limits on the real and imaginary part of the right-handed tensor anomalous coupling with respect to the left-handed vector-like SM coupling, $g_{R}/V_{L}$, are infered and shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:angles}c. In particular, the analysis sets a new limit on the imaginary part of $\mathrm{Im}(g_{R}/V_{L})\in[-0.17,0.23]$ at 95\% CL. This quantity was never measured before.


\section{Early cross section measurement at 13~TeV}

After the long shutdown, the LHC has been restarted at a new center-of-mass energy of 13~TeV. An early single top quark $t$-channel cross section measurement has been performed by CMS~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-15-004} with the first recorded data that corresponds to $42~\mathrm{pb}^{-1}$.
The analysis strategy follows closely the previous measurement at 8~TeV. Events with one isolated muon and two jets are selected where one jet is required to be b-tagged. The shape of the QCD multijet background is estimated from data by inverting the muon isolation requirement and fitting the transverse W boson mass distribution as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:singletop13}a. The pseudorapidity distribution of the foward, non b-tagged jet in the 2~jet 1~b-tag signal region (Fig.~\ref{fig:singletop13}b) is used to measure the single top quark cross section with a binned ML fit. An additional constraint on the $t\bar{t}$ yield is introduced by fitting the 3~jet 2~b-tags region (Fig.~\ref{fig:singletop13}c) simulaniously.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{center}
\caption{\label{fig:singletop13}The transverse W boson mass in (a)~2~jets 1~b-tag and the pseudo rapidity of the forward, non b-tagged jet in (b)~2~jets 1~b-tag and (c)~3~jets 2~b-tags.}
\end{figure}

The major sources of uncertainty are the data statistics (36\%), jet energy calibration (17\%) and luminosity (12\%).
The early single top quark $t$-channel analysis yields a cross section of
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{t\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}=274~\mathrm{pb}\pm98\mathrm{(stat)}\pm52\mathrm{(syst)}\pm33\mathrm{(lumi)}~\mathrm{pb}.
\end{equation}

The agrees within uncertainties to the expectation of $218_{-2}^{+5}\mathrm{(scale)}\pm5\mathrm{(PDF)}~\mathrm{pb}$ at NLO~\cite{Kidonakis-8tev}.

\section{Conclusion}
The latest results on $t$-channel single top quark production in pp collisions at the LHC have been reviewed.

Inclusive and fiducial measurements of the cross section have been established by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at 8~TeV. The ratio of the top quark over the antiquark cross section display a tension for some PDF sets as measured by both collaborations. Furthermore, insight into the electroweak coupling structure is gained by a novel analysis technique that utilizes an event-based likelihood to set limits on the anomalous tensor-like right-handed Wtb coupling.

Finally, an early cross section measurement has been accomplished by CMS that uses the first data at 13~TeV after the LHC restart.
